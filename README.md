# Cloud infrastructure â€” Terraform

This repo shows how to use Terraform to create a typical cloud infrastructure on the major cloud providers.

> _See also [cloud-infra-cli](https://github.com/weibeld/cloud-infra-terraform) for creating the same cloud infrastructure with the cloud providers' CLI clients._

- **[`gcp/`](gcp):** Terraform configuration for [Google Cloud Platfrom (GCP)](https://cloud.google.com/)

## Cloud infrastructure

The cloud infrastructure consists of the following generic components:

- A virtual private cloud (VPC) network
- A subnet (with a private IP address range of 10.0.0.0/16)
- Firewall rules that allow the following types of incoming traffic:
    - All traffic from other instances of the example infrastructure
    - HTTP traffic from everywhere
    - SSH traffic from your local machine
- 3 compute instances (running Ubuntu 18.04)

All compute instances get a public IP address and you will be able to connect to them with SSH from your local machine.

_The concrete resources that are created for each cloud provider are listed below._

## Prerequisites

You must have Terraform installed on your system.

For Linux, you can [download the appropriate Terraform binary](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) and move it to any directory in your `PATH`.

On macOS, you can install Terraform with:

```bash
brew install terraform
```

### Prerequisites

To enable Terraform to access your GCP account, you first need to create a [service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts), grant it appropriate permissions, and create a service account key for it.

Create a service account for Terraform:

```bash
gcloud iam service-accounts create terraform --display-name Terraform
```

Grant the [Editor](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/roles/details/roles%3Ceditor) role to the Terraform service account:

```bash
service_account=$(gcloud iam service-accounts list --filter 'displayName:Terraform' --format 'value(email)')
project_id=$(gcloud config list --format 'value(core.project)')
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding "$project_id" --member serviceAccount:"$service_account" --role roles/editor
```

Create a [service account key](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.serviceAccounts.keys) for the service account and save it on your local machine:

```bash
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create key.json --iam-account "$service_account"
```

The above command creates a file named `key.json` and saves it in your current working directory.

> Please make sure that the `key.json` file is located in the `gcp/` directory.
